# PROJECT-MARKSHEET
Have created a simple marksheet using c++ and oops concept 

The basic concepts of c++ are as follows :

-Header files are those files that store predefined functions.

-The "for" loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a known number of times.

-If-else statement controls conditional branching.

-The inline function is an enhancement feature that improves the execution time and speed of the program.

The data types we use

• Primitive Data Types
• Derived Data Types
• Abstract or User-Defined Data Types
"Object-oriented programming" concepts we have used -

▪ CLASS
▪ OBJECT
▪ ACCESS SPECIFIERS
▪ CONSTRUCTOR
▪ INHERITANCE
▪ DATA ABSTRACTION
